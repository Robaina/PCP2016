Supplementary Information
This file includes the code and data used in the study:

Metabolic Network Constrains Gene Regulation of C4 Photosynthesis: The Case of Maize

Semidán Robaina-Estévez, Zoran Nikoloski
Plant and Cell Physiology, 2016

*******************************************************
The files
  MaizeMoldel1 corresponds to the Maize Leaf Model
  MaizeModel2 corresponds to the Evidenced Maize Leaf Model

Both are taken from Seaver et al.,2015 Front. Plant Science


LeafData1=: Expression data from Wang et al., 2014, already mapped to MaizeModel1


LeafDataSub2=: Expression data from Pick et al., 2011, already
mapped to MaizeModel2


The original xml files of the used models are also provided (they have to be read into a COBRA structure)

The original expression data as well as gene identifiers are also provided

The function EXAMPLE serves as an example of the implementation of all code used in this study for the case of the maize leaf model (MaizeModel1) and LeafData1 (Wang et al, 2014)
